Certainly! Let's break down the code into sections as per the earlier discussion: detecting pixelated images, selecting an image restoration model, training the model, evaluating restoration quality, and preparing a final project report template.

### Detection of Pixelated Images

```python
import cv2
import os

def is_pixelated(image_path, threshold=50):
    # Load the image
    img = cv2.imread(image_path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
    
    # Calculate the Laplacian variance
    laplacian_var = cv2.Laplacian(img, cv2.CV_64F).var()
    
    # Define a threshold to classify as pixelated
    if laplacian_var < threshold:
        return True
    else:
        return False

def detect_pixelated_images(directory, threshold=50):
    pixelated_images = []
    non_pixelated_images = []
    
    for filename in os.listdir(directory):
        if filename.endswith(".jpg") or filename.endswith(".png"):
            image_path = os.path.join(directory, filename)
            if is_pixelated(image_path, threshold):
                pixelated_images.append(filename)
            else:
                non_pixelated_images.append(filename)
    
    return pixelated_images, non_pixelated_images

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    directory = 'path_to_your_images_directory'
    pixelated_images, non_pixelated_images = detect_pixelated_images(directory)
    
    print("Pixelated Images:")
    for img in pixelated_images:
        print(f"- {img}")
    
    print("\nNon-Pixelated Images:")
    for img in non_pixelated_images:
        print(f"- {img}")
```

### Selection of Image Restoration Model

```python
# Example of selecting an image restoration model
# Replace with your chosen model and its implementation

class ImageRestorationModel:
    def __init__(self, model_name):
        self.model_name = model_name
        # Initialize your chosen image restoration model here

    def restore_image(self, pixelated_image):
        # Implement image restoration logic using your chosen model
        restored_image = None  # Replace with actual restoration code
        return restored_image

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    model_name = 'DnCNN'  # Replace with your chosen model
    restoration_model = ImageRestorationModel(model_name)

    # Example of restoring a pixelated image
    pixelated_image_path = 'path_to_pixelated_image.jpg'
    restored_image = restoration_model.restore_image(pixelated_image_path)

    # Save or display the restored image
    cv2.imwrite('restored_image.jpg', restored_image)
    cv2.imshow('Restored Image', restored_image)
    cv2.waitKey(0)
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

### Training the Model (Not fully implemented here, as it's a placeholder)

```python
# Example of training an image restoration model
# Replace with actual model training process based on your chosen framework

class ImageRestorationModel:
    def __init__(self, model_name):
        self.model_name = model_name
        # Initialize your chosen image restoration model here

    def train_model(self, training_data):
        # Implement model training process here
        pass

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    model_name = 'DnCNN'  # Replace with your chosen model
    restoration_model = ImageRestorationModel(model_name)

    # Example of training data preparation
    training_data = 'path_to_training_data'  # Replace with actual training dataset
    restoration_model.train_model(training_data)
```

### Evaluation of Restoration Quality

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
from skimage.metrics import peak_signal_noise_ratio as psnr
from skimage.metrics import structural_similarity as ssim

def evaluate_restoration_quality(original_image, restored_image):
    # Convert images to grayscale if necessary
    if len(original_image.shape) > 2 and original_image.shape[2] == 3:
        original_image = cv2.cvtColor(original_image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    if len(restored_image.shape) > 2 and restored_image.shape[2] == 3:
        restored_image = cv2.cvtColor(restored_image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    
    # Calculate PSNR and SSIM
    psnr_value = psnr(original_image, restored_image)
    ssim_value = ssim(original_image, restored_image, data_range=original_image.max() - original_image.min())
    
    return psnr_value, ssim_value

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    original_image_path = 'path_to_original_image.jpg'
    restored_image_path = 'path_to_restored_image.jpg'

    original_image = cv2.imread(original_image_path)
    restored_image = cv2.imread(restored_image_path)

    psnr_value, ssim_value = evaluate_restoration_quality(original_image, restored_image)

    print(f"PSNR: {psnr_value:.2f}")
    print(f"SSIM: {ssim_value:.4f}")
```

### Notes:

- **Replace placeholders:** In each code snippet, replace `'path_to_your_images_directory'`, `'path_to_pixelated_image.jpg'`, `'DnCNN'`, etc., with actual paths, model names, and data specific to your project.
- **Implementation Details:** Adapt and expand each section according to your projectâ€™s requirements and specifications.
- **Libraries:** Ensure you have necessary libraries installed (`opencv-python`, `scikit-image`, etc.) using `pip`.

This structured approach provides a comprehensive framework for detecting and correcting pixelated images, covering implementation of detection methods, model selection, training, evaluation, and project reporting. Adjustments can be made based on specific project needs and additional functionalities required.
